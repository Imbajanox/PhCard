## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Migration** (with error checking):
   ```bash
   # Check if database exists before proceeding
   if mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'phcard';" | grep -q phcard; then
       echo "✓ Database 'phcard' found, proceeding with migration..."
   else
       echo "✗ Database 'phcard' not found. Please create it first."
       exit 1
   fi
   
   # Run migrations with error checking
   mysql -u root -p phcard < database_extensions.sql
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "✓ Extensions migration successful"
   else
       echo "✗ Extensions migration failed - check errors above"
       exit 1
   fi
   
   mysql -u root -p phcard < database_admin_and_cards.sql
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "✓ Admin and cards migration successful"
   else
       echo "✗ Admin and cards migration failed - check errors above"
       exit 1
   fi
   
   # Verify admin column was added
   if mysql -u root -p phcard -e "DESCRIBE users;" | grep -q is_admin; then
       echo "✓ Admin column verified"
   else
       echo "✗ Admin column not found"
   fi
   
   # Verify new cards were added
   echo "Checking card count..."
   mysql -u root -p phcard -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_cards FROM cards;"
   ```
