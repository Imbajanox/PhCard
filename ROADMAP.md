## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Team Structure (Suggested)
- **1 Full-stack Developer**: Core features, API development
- **1 Frontend Developer**: UI/UX, mobile optimization
- **1 Game Designer**: Card design, balance, content creation
- **1 Artist**: Card art, UI assets, animations
- **1 QA/DevOps**: Testing, deployment, monitoring

### Tools & Services Budget
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (Free tier sufficient initially)
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean/AWS (~$20-100/month)
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (Free tier)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry (Free tier up to 5k events)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (Free)
- **Database**: Managed MySQL (~$15-50/month)

---

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Average session duration
- Games played per user per day
- Retention rate (D1, D7, D30)

### Game Health
- Average match duration
- Card usage distribution (balance indicator)
- Win rate distribution (should be ~50% for balanced matchmaking)
- Deck diversity index

### Technical Metrics
- API response time (target: <100ms p95)
- Error rate (target: <1%)
- Uptime (target: 99.9%)
- Test coverage (target: >70%)

### Growth Metrics
- New user registrations per week
- Conversion rate (visitor â†’ registered user)
- Viral coefficient (organic referrals)
- Community size (Discord, forum members)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Scalability**: Current architecture may struggle with >10k concurrent users
  - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, load balancing, database optimization early
  
- **Security**: Multiplayer introduces attack vectors (cheating, exploits)
  - *Mitigation*: Server-side validation, rate limiting, regular audits

- **Code Quality**: Lack of tests makes refactoring risky
  - *Mitigation*: Add tests before major refactoring, use feature flags

### Business Risks
- **User Retention**: Players may leave without fresh content
  - *Mitigation*: Regular content updates, seasonal events, community engagement

- **Competition**: Similar games may attract users
  - *Mitigation*: Unique features, strong community, quality over quantity

- **Monetization**: Free-to-play model needs careful balance
  - *Mitigation*: Cosmetic-only purchases, generous F2P experience
